            <h2>Image sizes</h2>
            <p>
                Many devices these days have high density screens, meaning lots of pixels available for sharp images.
                So generally, we want images to have around 2x their actual size when measured in the browser on a largish screen.
                But we also want to be careful of not making images <em>too</em> big, in terms of file size, because we want to keep the site fast.
                It's all a bit of a compromise.
            </p>
            <p>Here's some guidelineage:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Work out roughly how wide the image will appear in the browser.</li>
                <li>Double that.</li>
                <li>Save photographs as <code>.jpg</code> files at that doubled resolution, using relatively high compression.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>'Relatively high compression' means, for a JPG export, the 'quality' slider usually ends up between 40% - 80%. Pull it down as low as possible until you start to see unacceptable artifacts (which in a jpeg manifest as sort of blurred blocks). Remember we are working at double resolution: some unacceptable artifacts are acceptable; they become acceptable by the time the image has been halved in size in the browser.</p>
            <p>Images of line art or logos or other non-photo content should be saved as <code>.png</code> files (select 'PNG24'). PNGs use lossless compression, so you don't get a quality slider, or any artifacts, but the file sizes are heavier.</p>
